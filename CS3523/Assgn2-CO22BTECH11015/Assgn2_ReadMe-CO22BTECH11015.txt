Assgn2_Src-CO22BTECH11015.cpp contains the main source code which has the 2 techniques implemented inside the code. Give the Input in the input file{inp.txt} as {N} {K} {C} {BT} {matrix elements in row order}. For Example:- 4 2 8 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 where n=4,k=2,C=8,BT=1; and the remaining integers are the elements of the 'A' matrix in row major order. Run the cpp file. The resulting square of the matrix along with the time of execution is given in outFile1, outFile2 for techniques 1 and 2 respectively.
